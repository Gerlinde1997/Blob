# Blob
Blob is a mini RPG game made with Godot Engine.

------------------------------
## Description
Blob loses all the colour of his slimy body, as Blob, you need to collect all the colours of the rainbow to become coloured again.
 
### Background
Blob is my first own (RPG) game. I started with making a game because I wanted to become more familiar with the basics of Object-Oriented Programming and improve my general programming skills. In addition, Godot has the scripting language GDScript, which is in the syntax very similar to Python. I already had some experience with Python, so Godot was a good choice for me to fully focus on learning OOP and the basics of game development.
